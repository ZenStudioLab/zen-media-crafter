## Core Mission
To provide an open-source, local-first tool that empowers users to craft high-quality media assets (memes, banners, ads, promos) using their own images and AI-driven layouts, while maintaining full control over privacy and customization.

## User Intent & Requirements

### 1. Multi-Format Generation
- **Inputs**: User-provided images (single or multiple) and an optional color palette.
- **Outputs**: Generate variety of formats including memes, banners, advertisements, and promotional images.
- **Scalability**: For every input/request, the tool should generate **N** unique outputs (configurable, default is 10).

### 2. Privacy & Local Control
- **Self-Hosted**: The tool is intended to run locally on the user's machine.
- **Own Keys**: Users provide their own API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) to ensure privacy and cost transparency.
- **Open Source**: The project is built for the community to extend and improve.

### 3. "Hybrid" Editable Experience
- **AI-Driven Layouts**: Text and background compositions are initially generated by AI to save time.
- **Manual Refinement**:
    - **Text**: Fully editable (content, font, size).
    - **Visuals**: Strategy to support color palette updates and element positioning.
- **Downloadable**: High-quality export/download of the final rendered result.

### 4. Technical Strategy (Scalability)
- **Plugin-First Architecture**: The tool must be easily extensible via the **Strategy Pattern**.
- **Swappable LLMs**: Support for different providers (OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, etc.) must be plug-and-play.
- **Swappable Renderers**: Support for multiple rendering technologies (HTML5 Canvas, SVG, Server-side Node-Canvas).
- **Engine-Agnostic Format**: Use `DesignJSON` as a universal intermediate format for layout definitions.

## Success Criteria
1. User can upload an image and receive 10 different banner/meme variations within seconds.
2. User can "tweak" the text of a generated meme without re-generating the whole image.
3. A developer can add a new LLM provider by simply implementing a TypeScript interface.
