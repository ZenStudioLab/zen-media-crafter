# 2026-02-28 — Phase 2 Setup

**Author:** Toan
**Tool:** Antigravity (Gemini AI)

## Summary
Started Phase 2 of feature work by focusing on the Redux state mechanism for Undo/Redo logic.

### Created
- `src/store/history-slice.ts` — Redux toolkit slice implementing `past` and `future` array histories containing `Project` entities to handle undo and redo actions correctly over the aggregate root.
- `src/__tests__/store/history-slice.test.ts` — Comprehensive unit tests demonstrating isolation and functional compliance to clearing and rotating references properly on undo, redo, and state save.

### Updated
- `src/store/index.ts` — Registered `historyReducer` into the global Redux configuration structure alongside previous modules.
- `task.md` — Injected Phase 7 tasks regarding history/state modifications and completed them successfully.

### Skills Applied
- `test-driven-development` — Adopted the Red-Green-Refactor logic to define the structural bounds of history states (`InitialState`, `saveHistoryState`, `undoHistory`, and `redoHistory`) before implementation.
